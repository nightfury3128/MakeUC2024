# Example safe email text
safe_email = """Hello Nipun,

Thanks so much for reaching out!!  I am sorry it took me so long to respond.  The last month has been a bit crazy. 

With our staff being primarily students, part of the difficulty of hiring is making sure to space peoples graduation dates out so that we don't have a large amount of paid staff leaving at one time.  With that consideration I have had some people that I would LOVE to hire, but am not able to due to their anticipated graduation and how many people we would have leaving at the same time.

Currently our potential staffing would not allow for me to hire any additional people with graduation dates in 2027.  That is not saying this could not change, but currently it is not something I could do.  If there are any changes, and it would make sense for us to talk more, I will reach out.

Very sorry, I know this is not what you wanted to hear!  

I definitely appreciate you!

Best,
Chris"""
