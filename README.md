background.js: Activates a background listener that logs a message when Phiserman is installed.

javascript
Copy code
chrome.runtime.onInstalled.addListener(() => {
    console.log("Phiserman installed!");
});
Content Script
content.js:

Scans Gmail and Outlook emails for phishing content.
Receives messages from popup.js to initiate the scan.
Flags suspicious emails by adding a red border and warning text.
Example function for flagging emails:

javascript
Copy code
function flagEmail(emailElement) {
    emailElement.style.border = '2px solid red';
    const warning = document.createElement('div');
    warning.innerText = '‚ö†Ô∏è Suspicious Email Detected';

    emailElement.prepend(warning);
}
User Interface Components
popup.html:

Provides the popup interface with controls to start and stop scanning.
Displays a progress bar and scan results for user feedback.
popup.js:

Connects with content.js to initiate scanning in the current tab.
Controls the progress animation and displays scan results in the popup.
javascript
Copy code
document.getElementById("start-button").addEventListener("click", () => {
    chrome.tabs.query({ active: true, currentWindow: true }, (tabs) => {
        chrome.tabs.sendMessage(tabs[0].id, { message: "scan_email" });
    });
});
style.css: Styles the popup interface, including the progress bar, buttons, and dialog layout, for a clean and professional look.

üîç How It Works
Initialization:

Phiserman initializes upon installation and provides a popup interface for users to interact with.
Scanning Process:

When the Start Scanning button is clicked, popup.js sends a command to content.js.
content.js scans the emails in Gmail or Outlook, sending each email‚Äôs data to a local server (server.py) for phishing detection.
Detection and Highlighting:

Emails identified as suspicious are flagged by adding a warning message and red border around the email in the interface.
:wrench: Backend (Server)
main.py and server.py:
These files set up a Flask server that receives email data from content.js and analyzes it to predict phishing emails.
server.py defines API routes to handle email data, while main.py runs the server.
